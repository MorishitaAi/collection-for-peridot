First, below I will share a concept related to AOSP ROM (MIUI Mod), Recovery and some other notes

## What is custom recovery?

Unofficial recoveries come from the manufacturer, you flash them at your own risk. They were originally released for Nexus devices.
Custom recovery is a third-party recovery environment. Flashing this recovery environment can replace stock recovery to bring many new advance functions that stock recovery don't have. In that way, an Android with a custom recovery is usually highly customizable. With a custom recovery on Android, you can handily install lots of unofficial ROMs, apps, themes, kernels and more. Moreover, you can easily fix permissions, perform, manage and restore backups and so on. But for most users, they flash custom recovery mainly for installing new ROMs.

## What is AOSP ROM (MIUI Mod)?

AOSP actually stands for Android Open Source Project. They were developed from Google and until now U have many ROMs such as Crdroid, EvolutionX, PlxelOS and many other ROMS. Refer here [AOSP](https://source.android.com/)

MIUI means ROM versions are modified according to user preferences. There will be different ROMs depending on your preferences.

## What is Kernelsu?

Stands for Kernel Assisted Superuser. KernelSU is a robust technique for rooting Android devices by working directly with the kernel. This approach grants root access to user space apps within the kernel space, providing extensive privileges not available in other rooting methods. Refer here [Kernelsu](https://kernelsu.org/guide/what-is-kernelsu.html)

## What is Magisk?

Initially we used Magisk to flash modules, although now there are variations of [magisk](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html)

## What is Unlock Bootloader?

Unlocking the Bootloader allows you to install custom firmware on your Android phone and gives you full access privileges to make modifications to the phone. Such modifications could involve changing some of the pre-loaded software, or could even include replacing the entire operating system. DO NOT USE A FASTBOOT COMMAND TO LOCK YOUR BOOTLOADER! If your system is not fully stock, using this command has the potential to hard brick your device, unless Mi Unlock allows you to unlock it again.
